i create games and put them in github so other people can play, so this is ping pong - classic - volume 1. the volume 1 is like the first version since i have to make a new repository to upload the new one with updates and fixed bugd do i decided do call it like volume instead of version  so yeah - click on the file - "so  yeah the link" - then just copy paste into your search browser and you should be able
play it as many times as you want, stay tuned im doing volumes and other games so remember my account when you want to play games, and give feedback.
